GimmehFixtures
==============

Provides a RESTful API to your fixtures so they can be consumed by external 
applications.  This is useful for giving an external test suite knowledge
of your fixtures without coupling the two code bases.

Runs only in test and development environments.

Example Usage
=============

1. Fire up your Rails app:
  $ script/server
   
2. Ask for all the fixtures:
  $ curl http://localhost:3000/fixtures.xml
   
3. Now, ask for one particular set of fixtures:
  $ curl http://localhost:3000/fixtures/users.json

4. Now your external test suite is empowered with 
   knowledge of your fixtures.  'grats, champ.
